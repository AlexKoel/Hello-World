Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Intuition is fucking important. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. You are not your fucking work. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Respect your fucking craft. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. Must-do is a good fucking master. Learn from fucking criticism. Never let your guard down!
